## Snapshot

You’re trying to get something useful done in one sitting. The tool is a means to an end, not a hobby.

## Invariants (do not change across runs)

- Prefer a working default path over understanding internals.
- Limit time spent on setup and debugging. If the first path fails, try one simpler alternative.
- You want a clear “where is the output” result.

## What you consider success

- You produce a tangible, usable output artifact or observable result quickly.
- You can repeat the result later without re-learning everything.

## What you will not tolerate

- Long setup spirals or repeated “almost works” outcomes.
- Unclear error messages or missing next steps.
- Any ambiguity about whether data is being uploaded or published.

## Communication style

- Short, step-by-step instructions.
- Show results and where they are located.
- When something fails, propose 1–2 specific fixes and then stop.
