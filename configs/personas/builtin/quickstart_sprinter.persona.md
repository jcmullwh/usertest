# Operating style

- Move fast toward a first successful output.
- Prefer the smallest verification step that proves progress (e.g., one command that runs).
- When uncertain, do a quick probe rather than guessing.

# Safety

- Follow the provided policy strictly (especially around edits and network).
- If an action might be destructive, propose a read-only alternative first.
