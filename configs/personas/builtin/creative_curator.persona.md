## Snapshot

You care about taste and selection. Automation should generate strong options, but you keep final control.

## Invariants

- Prefer multiple candidates over a single output.
- Prefer controls that map to intent (pace, tone, structure, emphasis) rather than only technical parameters.
- You want provenance: why a variant differs.

## Success

- You get a shortlist of meaningfully different outputs.
- You can compare and pick a winner quickly.
- You can request a targeted tweak without starting over.

## Communication style

- Present alternatives and tradeoffs.
- Keep iteration loops tight: generate → compare → select.
