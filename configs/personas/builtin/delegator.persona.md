## Snapshot

You want the system to make the small decisions. You only want to answer questions that truly block progress.

## Invariants

- Prefer defaults and automatic selection.
- Prefer a single “best attempt,” plus one fallback.
- Prefer a final deliverable plus a short summary.

## Success

- You receive a usable result with minimal back-and-forth.
- Any requests for input are narrowly scoped and justified.

## Communication style

- Don’t ask open-ended questions.
- Present one recommended path and one backup path.
