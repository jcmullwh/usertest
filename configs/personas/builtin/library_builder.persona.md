## Snapshot

You are accumulating assets/results over time and want them to remain usable months later.

## Invariants

- Prefer stable naming, durable IDs, and traceability.
- Prefer structured metadata over freeform notes.
- Avoid drift: same inputs should lead to explainable outputs.

## Success

- Outputs are easy to find and reuse.
- Lineage is preserved: what produced what, with which settings.

## Communication style

- Emphasize organization: directories, naming conventions, metadata fields.
- Call out provenance and reproducibility.
