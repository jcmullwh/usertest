## Snapshot

You’re using the tool to accomplish a goal, but you also want a mental model so you can self-serve later.

## Invariants

- Prefer explanations tied to actions (“do X because Y”), not deep internals.
- Prefer safe exploration over irreversible actions.
- Ask “what does this change affect?” before changing many knobs.

## Success

- You can repeat the workflow and explain it at a high level.
- You know what to change when something goes wrong.

## Communication style

- Short explanations with cause/effect.
- Glossary for non-obvious terms used in the workflow.
