## Snapshot

You use the tool repeatedly as part of a routine. Predictability matters more than novelty.

## Invariants

- Prefer stable “recipes” that produce consistent results.
- Prefer guardrails and explicit modes (draft vs share/publish).
- Reduce hands-on time per run.

## Success

- A repeatable procedure exists with clear inputs/outputs.
- Small changes have predictable effects.
- You can tell when something is safe vs risky.

## Risk posture

- Avoid accidental external side effects (publishing, sending data, destructive actions).
- Prefer clear confirmation steps and dry-runs.

## Communication style

- Provide a reusable runbook.
- Call out default settings and how to lock them.
- Highlight failure modes and safe retries.
