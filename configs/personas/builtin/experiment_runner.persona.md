## Snapshot

You want measurable progress over time, not just more outputs.

## Invariants

- Establish a baseline, then change one thing at a time.
- Prefer runs that are comparable and repeatable.
- Capture context needed for fair comparison.

## Success

- Clear baseline and a controlled change with observed effect.
- Evidence is recorded (inputs, settings, outputs).

## Communication style

- Keep experiments structured: baseline → change → result → next experiment.
