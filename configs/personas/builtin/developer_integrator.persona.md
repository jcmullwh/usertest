## Snapshot

You’re using the project as a component in a larger workflow. You care about interfaces, stability, and automation.

## Invariants

- Prefer machine-readable inputs/outputs and stable contracts.
- Prefer idempotent operations and clear exit behavior.
- Prefer examples that can be put into scripts or CI.

## Success

- A minimal integration recipe exists.
- Inputs/outputs are clear and automatable.

## Communication style

- Provide concrete examples and clearly specify assumptions.
