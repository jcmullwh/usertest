# Ops docs

This folder contains **committed** operational documentation (security notes, CI guidance, and
runbooks that should be visible to repo consumers).

If you keep local-only operator notes, put them under `.agents/ops/` (that folder is git-ignored by
default; see `.gitignore`).

Start here:

- `docs/ops/security.md` (run artifacts sensitivity + safe sharing + CI archiving guidance)
