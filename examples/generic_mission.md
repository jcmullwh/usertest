# Generic mission: Safe repo fit check

Assess fit quickly and safely.

Guidelines:
- Prefer discovery over heavy scripting.
- If you run commands, use lightweight inspection commands only.
- Do not edit files unless explicitly allowed by policy.
- Stop once confidence is sufficient to decide (don't try to understand everything).
