# Packages

Packages are **reusable libraries**.

Each folder under `packages/` is an independent Python project with its own `pyproject.toml`.

Some packages are snapshot-published to a **private** GitLab PyPI registry.

- Model and consumption: `docs/monorepo-packages.md`
- Operator workflow: `docs/how-to/publish-snapshots.md`

If you’re looking for “how to run usertests”, start with `apps/usertest` and
`docs/tutorials/getting-started.md`.
